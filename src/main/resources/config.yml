# Note: Smaller area and height values result in less lag.
# baseBlockSpeeds speed less than 0.4 may not work well.
# autoPlace will automatically move players to be fully in the elevator
# checkFloor will make sure all floors have glass blocks (at the cost of possible lag when starting a lift)
# preventEntry will prevent players from entering an active elevator (at the cost of possible lag when lifts are running)
# soundVolume (0-100) defines the relative volume for all sounds.
